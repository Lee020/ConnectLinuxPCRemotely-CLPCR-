# ConnectLinuxPCRemotely-CLPCR-
After years of struggling with CLPCR, relief finally comes, but the real question is: Do we need to rely on high personal computing power or pay for global connectivity? The answer is no. Instead, we should be able to build our own powerful PC as a globally accessible server, ensuring complete privacy of life and data. Big LLMs are often trained on publicly scraped data, including licensed content and personal blogs, but user interactions and private data are excluded unless explicitly shared. However, social media and big data carriers often have confusing privacy policies that users donâ€™t fully read, leaving them vulnerable. The goal is to empower individuals to take control over their own data and privacy by setting up their own servers, not relying on centralized systems that profit off our data without full transparency. 


AIM:This project starts with a simple, tested flow to make your PC globally accessible, then transitions into a privacy-focused goal of migrating from proprietary to open-source systems. By hosting your own services and using open-source tools, you regain control of your data and reduce reliance on centralized, commercial platforms.




components:
1)ngrok-freetire
2)ttyd ->Linux Package
3)Gmail App password
4)APP.py file.


**1)ngrok**

  ===INSTALLATION===
  curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
  && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com bookworm main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
  && sudo apt update \
  && sudo apt install ngrok
  
  ===CONFIGURATION===
  ngrok config add-authtoken <token-id>
  
  ===START_SERVING===
  ngrok http 9988

**2)ttyd**
===INSTALLATION===
sudo apt install ttyd

===START_SERVING===
ttyd -p 9988 bash


3)create smtp server to send ngrok url to mail
 a)create file ".msmtprc" home directory & add lines
    ====================================================
    defaults
    auth           on
    tls            on
    tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
    logfile        ~/.msmtp.log
    
    account        gmail
    host           smtp.gmail.com
    port           587
    from           example@gmail.com
    user           example@gmail.com
    password       password
    
    account default : gmail
    ====================================================
b)place app.py and ttyd-ngrok-gmail.sh in Home directory and chage permission to executable mode..
c)make app.py as system service 



**How to use** 
1)send mail message "trigger" to mail configured in app.py
2)After some time you will get URL reply from your system to your Gmail. Use that URL to access your PC globally

=================================================Targets============================================================
1)Replacement for ngrok service with open source tunneling service
2)Developement of vscode plugin
3)Andoid application for secure remote connection
